    <p>This <a href="#finishTokens">Token Generator Tool</a> allows users to generate replacement Parkrun finish tokens
      and (in the future will) allow custom runner barcodes to be generated.  Details of what it does and how it works are in the <a href="#about">About</a> section below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are any issues please email <a href="mailto:graham@openseizuredetector.org.uk">graham@openseizuredetector.org.uk</a>.

    <p>Not done yet.....  The idea is to allow users to generate barcodes
      of different sizes with various borders etc.   I'll need someone
      artistic to help with this though!</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>This tool was developed because at Hartlepool Parkrun we were having
      issues with 'losing' finishing tokens from our nice set of the new
      (2019) style  finish tokens.   We were replacing them with tokens from
      our old set which were a different shape...and the reason we scrapped
      the old set was that they were worn and difficult to scan.   The
      barcode stickers that we had were only good for a couple of uses then
      started to wear off and become just as difficult to scan.   Rather
      than go to the waste of buying a whole new set of tokens for a few
      replacements, I decided to make our own temporary replacements that
      would be compatible with the
      <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkrun.virtualVolunteer&hl=en_GB&gl=US' target="_blank" >
	'Virtual Volunteer'</a> scanning app.
    </p>
    <p>I thought that other parkruns might be in a similar position so might
      find it useful, so turned it into a web based application
    </p>
    
    <h2>What it Does</h2>
    <p>The <a href="#finishTokens">Finish Token Generator Tool</a> takes a user-specified list of finish
      positions for which tokens are to be generated and the name of the
      parkrun they are for.  It then generates one or more Scalable Vector
      Graphics SVG) files that represent A4 pages to be printed to make the
      tokens.   These are downloaded in a zip file onto the user's computer.
      The user opens the file and prints out each page in turn.
    </p>
    <img width=400px src='token_page.png' alt="Example Token Page"/>
    <img width=200px src="./tokens.png" alt="Image of Generated Tokens"/>
    <p>
      The user can then laminate the printed pages and cut out the
      tokens.
      The size is similar to the Parkrun tokens so they can be
      stacked along with the real tokens.   An example of the finished
      tokens is shown above.
    </p>
    <p>Note:  The generated page is designed to be printed in landscape
      format - if you print it in portrait mode it may be scaled to fit on
      the page, resuting in undersized tokens.
      </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The tool is completely free and Open Source (<a href='https://github.com/jones139/parkrun_tokens/blob/main/LICENSE' target="_blank" >GPL v3 Licence</a>).  The source code is available on GitHub in my <a href='https://github.com/jones139/parkrun_tokens'>parkrun_tokens repository</a> for anyone to use or modify.  It is written in Python so quite easy to see what it is doing.
      </p>
    <p>The heart of the system is the open source
      <a href='https://github.com/WhyNotHugo/python-barcode.git'>python-barcode library</a>
      which is used to generate the barcode part of the token as SVG graphics.
      The
      <a href='https://github.com/jones139/parkrun_tokens/blob/main/finish_tokens.py'>finish_tokens.py</a>
      script accepts a list of position numbers and a
      parkrun name and generates a single SVG image of the finish token for
      each finish position.  If the user requests more tokens than will fit on
      an A4 page, it generates multiple pages as separate SVG files.
      finish_tokens.py can be run as a simple command line application.
    </p>
    <p>I am conscious that many people are not used to using command line
      utilities, so I thought I should provide a graphical interface.
      To save the trouble of trying to work out how to install it on
      Windows and Macintosh computers, I made it a web application.
      The web application is in the <a href='https://github.com/jones139/parkrun_tokens/blob/main/main.py'>main.py</a> script, which uses the Flask python web framework.
    <p>A couple of people have tried to persuade me that using Docker
      containers is a good way of distributing web applications, so I have
      tried that.   Typing 'make build' will build a docker image for the
      app, then 'make start' will run it.  The web page should be visible at
      http://localhost:56733.  I have it running on a virtual server at
      https://barcodes.ddns.net where the nginx web server redirects to the
      port 56733 so the end user does not need to know about that.
    </p>
